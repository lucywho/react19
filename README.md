# About this repo

This is a test app that I am using to explore new features in React 19

It is based on the [What's new in React 19 tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81uAxzeyL2I) by [Bob Ziroll](https://bsky.app/profile/bobziroll.bsky.social) on the [Free Code Camp YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp) but using TypeScript and with some of my own tweaks.
